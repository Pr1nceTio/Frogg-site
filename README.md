## Frogg-site (Infopage, Quiz and Game on the theme of Frogs)

**Proposal:** This website is a fun way to displayed my web-dev skills with HTML and CSS and my knowledge of applications
and client-side scripting with Javascript. This application should be free for anyone to use, however its intended 
audience is primarily teens and pre-teens. This project was of intrest to me, as it was my first ever coding project
and was one i did in high-school, now that I have an increase amount coding knowledge, I was looking to apply concepts
and practices I have picked up learning and workign with other languages and see if those skills are transferable. My goal
was to accomplish all of this while refreshing my knowledge on HTML, CSS, and Javascript which being the first languages I
learnt have begun to fade with time. I went into this project with a very relax and free mindset, to test a variety of
new things and experiment anyways I can, while still creating an enjoyable experience.


## Current Tasks
- Add more questions of different types to quiz (multiple choice, select all that apply)
- Have more questions than displayed and randomize order and questions that are displayed
