        <h2>Basic Facts</h2>

        <p>Frogs are <em>amphibians</em>, which comes from the Greek language and means "both lives." Most frogs are born in water as tadpoles and gradually change into frogs although some frogs, known as direct developers, are born as full frogs. This allows them to be born and live far away from water, such as on mountaintops.</p>
  
      <h2>Diet</h2>
  
        <p>A frog mainly lives on <em>insects</em> and <em>small animals</em> like earthworms, minnows and spiders.</p>
  
      <h2>Population</h2>
  
        <p>There are approximately <em>4,740 species of frogs</em> around the entire world. There are about 90 species of frogs in the United States. Unfortunately, about 120 amphibian species, including frogs, toads and salamanders, have disappeared since 1980. Historically, one species of amphibian would disappear every 250 years.</p>
  
      <h2>Range</h2>
  
        <p>Frogs can be found on every continent in the world <strong>except</strong> Antarctica. However, the highest concentration of frogs is found in <em>warmer tropical climates.</em></p>
  
      <h2>Behaviour</h2>
  
        <p>Frogs are known as indicator species and can give scientists valuable insight into how an ecosystem is functioning. Because they are predators and prey many animals are affected by them, <em>frogs provide insight</em> into the health of the ecosystem.</p>
  
      <h2>Bonus Facts</h2>
  
        <p>Did you know that? :</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The world's tiniest frogs are smaller than a dime, and the largest frog can grow to be longer than a foot and weigh more than 7 pounds!</li>
              <li>Frogs don't need to drink the way we do: they absorb water through their permeable skin!</li>
              <li>A Frog's call is unique to it's species, and some frog calls can be heard from up to a mile away</li>
              <li>Some frogs can jump over 20 times their own body length, that equivalent to a human jumping 30m</li>
            </ul>
